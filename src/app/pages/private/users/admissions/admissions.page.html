    <h2>Entry at 7+</h2>
    <p>We invite children to discover the school. At this age, we will need to assess childâ€™s learning skills as well as English and Mathematics knowledge.</p>
    <p>Testing and exams are always stressful for both adults and children, which consequently affects the results. However, it is never an issue with our assessment as we offer a child just a game to play.</p>
    <p>In our unique specially designed board game, a child can reach the finish successfully completing different tasks and solving questions. They may be written, oral, intellectual, linguistic, involve sports, drama acting etc.</p>
    <p>We offer places at Oxford Prime Academy based on the assessment and interaction with the child during the visit.</p>
